    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    
    <div class="legal-content">
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing and using our service, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Use License</h2>
        <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials on our website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose or for any public display;</li>
            <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on our website;</li>
            <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The materials on our website are provided on an 'as is' basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
        <p>In no event shall our company or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on our website, even if we or our authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate your account at any time for any reason, with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the service will cease immediately.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which our company is incorporated and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that state or location.</p>
